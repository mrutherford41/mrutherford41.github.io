## Just Start

This blog has been in making for years now. Deciding what platform to use, the design, how to express your life with 1's and 0's accurately.
Overthinking every minute detail. Technological hardware hiccups setting everything back.

...but I'm finally going to make it happen. I don't want another year to go by and have nothing to look back on with everything that has 
happened and all that life has in store for me. 2026 is a fresh start for me to make my life whatever I want it to be and give all versions of
myself that exist what they've always dreamed of and thought they would never get. But that longing is over and from the past years I know
beautiful things can happen for me and they will.
